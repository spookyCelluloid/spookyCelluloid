Assisted living offers a warm, supportive, and nuturing atmosphere for individuals who require some help but still want to keep their self-reliance. Why choose assisted living? Studies reveal that living near peers and participating in social activities leads to a more fulfilling life. With assisted living, you\'ll find senior-friendly living options and a dedicated staff. Communities have additional services that include 24-hour supervision and security, emergency response systems, access to licensed nursing care, chef-prepared meals, and assistance with grooming, dressing, and bathing. Housekeeping, laundry, social programs, and local transportation are usually provided, too. This community, a comprehensive independent living community, allows you to do as you wish, when you wish, but without the burdens of home ownership that can tie you down and take up your time. Serving both individuals and couples, these senior communities are also known as senior apartments, retirement villages, and communities for 55 and older. Residents stay in private apartments or individual homes with a variety of community amenities, services, and programs tailored specifically for seniors. Your personal belongings, such as furniture and favorite mementos, can move to your new home with you. With maintenance, groundskeeping, and housekeeping taken care of, seniors can focus on goals and passions instead of the daily demands of home ownership. Because independent living communities are intended for older adults who need little or no assistance, most do not offer medical care or supervision. Community services and amenities usually include fitness clubs, dining facilities, swimming pools, golf courses, hiking trails, social events, and more. Marymount Greenhills Retirement Center provides a low-maintenance lifestyle and the assistance seniors need to enjoy retirement. With comprehensive assisted living and independent living services, and with a caring environment, seniors can feel relaxed and secure.

('This review is long overdue. Over a half a year ago, my mother spent six weeks at Pacifica Nursing and Rehab after having spinal surgery. Before she was released from the hospital, I had been reading Yelp reviews of the other skilled nursing facilities in the area, and I was horrified by the Dickensian horrors I read about.\nAt that point, it was unclear whether Pacifica Nursing and Rehab would have a vacant bed to take my mom, so I can\'t tell you what a huge relief it was when her health care provider was able to get her into this place, and not one of its awful competitors.\nThe staff here are amazing people, and seeing everything they did for my mother, I have learned to truly respect and revere certified nursing assistants. CNAs don\'t get paid enough, yet they are truly the unsung heroes of this industry. And Pacifica Nursing and Rehab has the nicest, most hard-working CNAs you could ever hope to meet.\nAlso, special shout out to Amy in physical therapy. My mom was probably the most difficult customer she\'d had in years, but when it was time for mom to come home, Amy gave her a hug and told her how much she had enjoyed working with her.\nIf you have a loved one who needs to spend some time in a SNF, this is the place for them to be.',5,1,1,'10/31/2015'),

In order for me to have my confidence to return home I had a number of items to check off my list.  This department worked with me every day:  5 days one hour with physical and occupational therapist.  This was so crucial for me to begin my healing process.\nThe team of nurses were awesome!  They were right on top of their game.  They had activities for us in the activity room which was a nice surprise\nespecially the cooking and baking class by Ruby.  I loved the part of getting to know the nurse as individuals and stories that we shared when I would have my 4am Meds and blood work.\nMeals were huge and delicious!!

I have no doubts that any of the previous reviews and complaints are true because I\'ve seen it happen.\n\nYour loved one will not be turned frequently if they need to be. This is frustrating for nurses because we care for the wounds and they just seem to get worse. And if your loved one ever gets changed it won\'t be done properly. Almost everyone here develops incontinent dermatitis. Oh yeah and if you have a foley, be prepared to get a UTI. Everyone here gets a UTI. I\'ve seen poop stains and chunks on foleys literally right outside the urethral opening.\n\nI\'ve seen missed IV antibiotics. Oh yeah missed medications, that happens allllll the time. Meds being documented that they are being given but really aren\'t. Incorrect insulin and heparin doses being given because nurses are incompetent at math and don\'t understand they come in ratios.\n\nMissed wound care? Sometimes that happens too. If your loved one has a wound vac it may not be changed. Yep it\'ll just pool up with blood and cause sepsis. Oh and like I said previously, infection infection infections. You\'ll probably get one if you\'re at risk here with any kind of wound.\n\nThen you have the false documentations and coverups. Don\'t get me wrong. The nurses try their best. But in this industry of nursing homes or post acute care facilities, they are horribly regulated. The amount of work put onto the nurses here is ridiculous. Just ask any of the families of the residents that have been here a few months. They stay longer than 80% of the nurses here. If you have nurses of all types constantly rotating in and out, you have failed as a leader and this directly falls on the director of nursing here. As long as it\'s the snake Alicia. You better send your family elsewhere. They eat nurses. They set them up to fail. And your loved one pays the price.\n\nDo yourself a favor and hire in home care giving. Nursing homes are poorly regulated. But if you have to, do some research and find the rare facilities that do take care of their nurses which lead to proper nursing care. Just stay away from this place.',1,4,2,'12/31/2015'),
